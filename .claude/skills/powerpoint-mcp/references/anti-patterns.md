# Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Common mistakes when using the PowerPoint MCP tools. These cause errors, data loss, or wasted
turns — avoid them.

## Forgetting to Start a Session

### The Problem

Calling a domain tool without a valid `session_id`:

```
WRONG:
slide(action: "add-blank", session_id: "made-up-id")  → success: false, "Unknown sessionId"
```

### The Solution

Always start a session first and reuse the exact `sessionId` string it returns:

```
CORRECT:
result = presentation(action: "open", filePath: "C:\Decks\q4.pptx")
sessionId = result.sessionId
slide(action: "add-blank", session_id: sessionId)
```

## Creating Then Re-Opening the Same File

### The Problem

Treating `presentation(action: "create", ...)` like the old standalone create call and then opening
the same file again:

```
WRONG:
presentation(action: "create", filePath: "C:\Decks\q4.pptx") → sessionId A
presentation(action: "open", filePath: "C:\Decks\q4.pptx")   → sessionId B
```

### The Solution

`create` already returns a live session. Reuse it directly:

```
CORRECT:
result = presentation(action: "create", filePath: "C:\Decks\q4.pptx")
sessionId = result.sessionId
slide(action: "add-blank", session_id: sessionId)
```

## Wrong Index Base (0-Based Instead of 1-Based)

### The Problem

Treating `slide_index`/`shape_index`/table `row`/`column` as 0-based, matching most programming
languages:

```
WRONG: assuming the first slide is index 0
shape(action: "get-count", session_id: ..., slide_index: 0)  → success: false (out of range)
```

### The Solution

Every index in this tool surface is 1-based, matching PowerPoint's own object model:

```
CORRECT:
shape(action: "get-count", session_id: ..., slide_index: 1)  → the first slide
```

See `behavioral-rules.md` for the full indexing rule.

## Forgetting to Save

### The Problem

Making changes, then closing without saving:

```
WRONG:
slide(action: "add-blank", session_id: ...)
textframe(action: "set-text", session_id: ..., ...)
presentation(action: "close", sessionId: ...)   → changes since last save are LOST
```

### The Solution

Close with save enabled when changes were made:

```
CORRECT:
slide(action: "add-blank", session_id: ...)
textframe(action: "set-text", session_id: ..., ...)
presentation(action: "close", sessionId: ..., save: true)
```

## Expecting Close to Block

### The Problem

Waiting for or polling after `presentation(action: "close", ...)`, assuming it does not return
until PowerPoint's process has fully exited:

```
WRONG:
presentation(action: "close", sessionId: ...)
presentation(action: "list")  → repeatedly poll, waiting for POWERPNT.exe to disappear from Task Manager
```

### The Solution

Close returns as soon as the session is removed from the registry; PowerPoint's own process cleanup
happens in the background afterward and can take up to a few minutes. The session is already gone
from `presentation(action: "list")` immediately; do not wait on the OS process.

## Skipping Visual Verification

### The Problem

Trusting `success: true` from a shape/chart/table/image call as proof the slide looks right:

```
WRONG:
chart(action: "add-chart", session_id: ..., slide_index: ..., ...)  → success: true
presentation(action: "close", sessionId: ..., save: true)
# Never looked at the rendered slide — chart could be mis-sized, overlapping, or have wrong data
```

### The Solution

Export and inspect the result before saving/closing when visual content was added or changed:

```
CORRECT:
chart(action: "add-chart", session_id: ..., slide_index: ..., ...)
export(action: "export-slide-to-image", session_id: ..., slide_index: ..., output_path: ...)
# Inspect the image, fix issues found
presentation(action: "close", sessionId: ..., save: true)
```

## Delete-and-Rebuild for Small Changes

### The Problem

Deleting and re-creating a shape/table/chart to make a small change:

```
WRONG: fixing one table cell
shape(action: "delete", session_id: ..., slide_index: ..., shape_index: ...)
table(action: "add-table", session_id: ..., slide_index: ..., rows: 4, columns: 3, ...)
# ... re-populate every cell from scratch ...
```

### The Solution

Use the targeted update action for the specific thing that changed:

```
CORRECT:
table(action: "set-cell-text", session_id: ..., slide_index: ..., shape_index: ..., row: 3, column: 2, text: "$1.8M")
```

Same principle for shapes: prefer `shape(action: "set-position", ...)`/`shape(action: "set-size",
...)` over delete-and-recreate (see `slides-and-shapes.md`).

## Session Leaks

### The Problem

Opening several presentations and never closing them:

```
WRONG:
presentation(action: "open", filePath: "file1.pptx")  → session 1
presentation(action: "open", filePath: "file2.pptx")  → session 2
presentation(action: "open", filePath: "file3.pptx")  → session 3
# ... none ever closed
```

Each open session holds its own `POWERPNT.exe` process. Left unclosed, they accumulate, consume
memory, and keep file locks on disk.

### The Solution

Close each session when its work is done, saving first if changes were made:

```
CORRECT:
s1 = presentation(action: "open", filePath: "file1.pptx")
# ... work ...
presentation(action: "close", sessionId: s1, save: true)

s2 = presentation(action: "open", filePath: "file2.pptx")
# ... work ...
presentation(action: "close", sessionId: s2, save: true)
```

## Assuming Multi-Series Charts in a Single Create Call

### The Problem

Trying to pass multiple series into a single `chart(action: "add-chart", ...)` call when a more
explicit series-management workflow is needed.

### The Solution

Use `chart(action: "add-chart", ...)` for the initial chart, then `chart(action: "add-series", ...)`
for additional series, or `chart(action: "replace-chart-data", ...)` when replacing the whole data
set.

## Guessing Layout Names

### The Problem

Passing an invented or approximate `layout_name` to `layout(action: "set-layout", ...)` (for
example, `"Blank"`, `"TitleSlide"`):

```
WRONG:
layout(action: "set-layout", session_id: ..., slide_index: ..., layout_name: "TitleSlide")  → success: false
```

### The Solution

Use the exact `PpSlideLayout` enum member name (`ppLayoutTitle`, `ppLayoutBlank`, etc.) — see
`layouts.md` for the common ones.

## Discovery Loop Without Action

### The Problem

Repeating `presentation(action: "list")`, `slide(action: "get-count", ...)`, or
`shape(action: "get-count", ...)` multiple times without acting on the result.

### The Solution

Call a discovery action once, then act on what it returned. If a session genuinely expired,
reopen it once and continue — do not loop on the same discovery call more than twice in a row.
